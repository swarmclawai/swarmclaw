# Task 11c47f23: Fix NO_MESSAGE at connector level

- Status: completed
- Agent: fcd98bac
- Session: 10ab6e5f

## Description
NO_MESSAGE check is in session loop, but messages sent via connector_message_tool bypass that check. Apply NO_MESSAGE filter at the connector delivery layer so all outbound paths respect it.

## Result Summary
The fix adds a `NO_MESSAGE` check in `sendConnectorMessage()` — the centralized outbound delivery function — so that both the normal connector reply path and the `connector_message_tool` path respect it. If the text is `NO_MESSAGE` and there's no media attached, the send is suppressed and returns early with no error. Media sends are allowed through even with `NO_MESSAGE` text, since the agent clearly intends to deliver content.
