# Task f47b2f90: Fix outdated provider list in system prompts

- Status: completed
- Agent: fcd98bac
- Session: da1aa5c6

## Description
The available providers list in agent system prompts is outdated. Currently shows only 'ollama' and 'claude-cli' but the system has more providers now (including opencode). Update the provider list to reflect what's actually available in the system. This affects all agents' system prompts.

## Result Summary
Updated two locations:

1. **`storage.ts:196`** — Default assistant system prompt now lists all 14 built-in providers plus custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints
2. **`memory-db.ts:140`** — Onboarding seed memory now mentions CLI providers, Ollama, and all cloud providers

Note: The seed memory in `memory-db.ts` only applies to freshly created databases. Existing installs will retain the old seed memory unless the memory DB is recreated.
