- Status: completed
- Agent: fcd98bac
- Session: 16378057

## Description
After CLI task completes: commit all changes, push to remote, verify README.md and docs reflect all new features (NO_MESSAGE, agent mesh, CLI). Update if needed.

## Result Summary
All done. Here's the summary:

**Commits pushed (3):**
1. `ec64ac9` — Initialize all CLI session fields at every session creation point (8 files)
2. `a7c1cad` — Add OpenCode session resume handle to chat header
3. `0e4d4b2` — Persist CLI session and delegate resume IDs after each chat turn

**Gitignore:** Added `data/.sqlite_migrated` to prevent data artifacts from being tracked.

**README verification — all three features are documented:**
- **NO_MESSAGE** — Chat Connectors section (line 180): agents suppress replies to acknowledgments
- **Agent mesh/orchestration** — Features list (line 28): "Multi-agent workflows powered by LangGraph with automatic sub-agent routing", plus Manage Sessions/Agents platform tools
- **CLI** — Three CLI providers table (lines 117-123), CLI delegation tool (line 197), CLI troubleshooting section (lines 252-260)

Working tree is clean, branch is up to date with `origin/main`.
