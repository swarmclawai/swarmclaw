# Task 19586dfc: Build agent execution logging with query interface

- Status: completed
- Agent: fcd98bac
- Session: eb10dcc4

## Description
Create structured execution logging for agent actions so Hal 2K can query:

1. **What triggered an action** - incoming message, schedule, webhook, heartbeat, etc.
2. **Why decisions were made** - reasoning chains, tool calls with inputs/outputs
3. **Outbound actions** - messages sent, their order, and why
4. **File operations** - what files touched, checksums before/after
5. **Commit activity** - what committed, commit IDs

Infrastructure:
- Logs stored in SQLite (logs.db already referenced in db.ts)
- CLI command: `swarmclaw logs <sessionId> --filter X --since Y`
- Hal 2K can call: logs_tool or similar to query
- Ability to clear logs: `swarmclaw logs clear <sessionId>`

Use existing patterns from scripts/logs.ts as starting point.

## Result Summary
