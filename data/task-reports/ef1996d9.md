# Task ef1996d9: [CLI] Final: Commit, Push, Update Docs/README

- Status: completed
- Agent: fcd98bac
- Session: 30605e04

## Description
After CLI implementation completes:

1. Commit all CLI changes with clear message
2. Push to remote
3. Update README.md with CLI installation and usage
4. Update any relevant docs
5. Verify everything pushed

Note: NO_MESSAGE connector fixes already committed separately.

## Result Summary
Looking at the recent CLI commits, these are **internal reliability fixes** (session field initialization, resume ID persistence, OpenCode session handle in chat header) — not new user-facing features. The README already thoroughly documents CLI providers, CLI delegation tools, and CLI troubleshooting.

Here's the status:

- **All changes committed** — working tree is clean
- **All commits pushed** — no unpushed commits (`origin/main` is up to date)
- **README already covers CLI** — providers table (line 119-123), CLI delegation tool (line 197), CLI troubleshooting section (line 252-260)
- **No new user-facing CLI features** to document — the commits were session persistence and initialization fixes

Everything is already done. No further action needed.
