# Task 3d03410d: Add context management tools for agents

- Status: completed
- Agent: fcd98bac
- Session: 8b03e591

## Result Summary
I've explored the codebase and understand the current tool system and context handling. Key findings:

- Tools are defined in `session-tools.ts` using LangChain's `tool()` + Zod schemas
- History is hardcoded to **last 20 messages** with no trimming or summarization
- No existing context management exists — messages are passed raw to the LLM
- Memory system (FTS5 + vector) exists separately in `memory-db.ts`

I'd like to know which context management tools you want before writing the plan. Could you select from the options above, or describe what you have in mind?

## Changed Files
- Tools are defined in `session-tools.ts` using LangChain's `tool()` + Zod schemas
- Memory system (FTS5 + vector) exists separately in `memory-db.ts`

## Commands Run
- Not provided

## Verification
- No existing context management exists — messages are passed raw to the LLM
